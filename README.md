### Hi there, I'm Kent ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Materials, Additive Manufacturing, and Operations Engineer with 5+ years of experience bringing complex physical products to life, from industrial 3D printers to medical devices. My professional world has been one of atoms, materials, and manufacturing lines.

This GitHub profile is my space to document my journey into the world of bits, data, and algorithms as I pursue my Master's in Big Data & Analytics. Here, I'm building projects that merge my engineering background with my passion for data.

### My First Projects & My Approach to Learning

As I begin this journey, my first projects will be developed with the assistance of AI tools. I believe in using modern tools to accelerate learning and understand current development workflows. My goal is to be transparent about this process, documenting what I'm learning and how I'm applying it to solve tangible, industry-relevant problems.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and building with: **Python**, **SQL**, and **Machine/Deep Learning for industrial applications**.
- ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m interested in: **Statistical Process Control (SPC)**, **Design of Experiments (DOE)**, **Predictive Maintenance**, **Computer Vision for Quality Control**, **Digital Twins**, **Process Simulation**, **Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies**.
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about: **Additive Manufacturing**, **Materials Science**, or my transition into data.

I'm open to feedback, collaboration, and connecting with others who are passionate about the future of digital manufacturing.
